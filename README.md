# workspace for BLAC motor linearization
1. Initial version for software linearization of BLAC motor
2. Introduction

In real world the permanent magnet AC motor is not as ideal. Tha latest motor develpmment trends shows that mid and high-end segment motors are close to ideal. Thanks to the advanced CAD product than manufacturer use. 
Unfortunately, the low-end segment motors suffer for non-linearity â€“ many tradeoff has been made, price, weight, power density.


Note at this stage only the design sketches are created.
Later on, the C code will be generated
